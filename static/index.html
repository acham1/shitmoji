            "Quinn!! You are my GUY -- CJ Apel",
            "Quinn and I went on a couple of ski trips, and he's killer in trees and moguls. I definitely murdered my quads trying to keep up with him on some blacks lmao -- Eric Summins",
            "Quinn taught me that the only programming language worth learning and using is Elixir. He then proceeded to send me many, many Github profiles of accomplished Elixir engineers for us to try and hire. -- Daniel Kornreich",
            "Quinn was my first Phone Screen ever. Having contributed to hiring him is my biggest contribution to LiveRamp by far -- Romain Faugeroux",
            "One of my first interactions with Quinn was running into him and @jlang in the elevator (probably going for a scratchers run), and asking if they were related. They immediately lied about being brothers, and I could tell from then on that we were going to be friends. Going to the back bar and hearing Quinn’s booming laugh was always an indicator of a great time to come, and I can’t count the number of Friday nights I’ve spent draining LR of their beer budget with him. 10/10 dude, my only regret is that I secretly didn’t know which one was Josh and which one was Quinn for a period of time that I’m uncomfortable admitting -- Stephen Frost",
            "Does anyone think it's a coincidence that Quinn is leaving and that RampCamp is cancelled this year? I ask because he always made RampCamp great and I would certainly miss him a lot -- Ian Ekblaw",
            "My interview with Quinn mostly involved talked about sandwiches -- Zachary Cicala",
            "I once saw Quinn straight up deliver a newborn baby llama from the back of a taxicab in the tenderloin. Good guy -- CJ Apel",
            "Quinn stepped up last minute and was Camp Counselor at RampCamp 2019 - there would have been a lot of lost people at Camp Navarro that year without him (though no guarantees people didn't get lost following him back to his campsite). Without Quinn and his fancy headset, who the hell is going to run our Annual Chess Tournament and Trivia Nights with @cjapel? They still owe the public a guest appearance from Matt Bellamy... the people may never forgive him for that empty promise... -- Roeh Quisao",
            "Quinn and I have a super fun bit where he makes me out to be a Disney movie villain and I just lean into it and give him as much ammo as possible. Last summer a few weeks before RampCamp I was voluntold to be a camp counselor and really rubbed it in his face, explaining that I was more reliable and likable and just all around a better human and that's why I was asked and he wasn't. RampCamp came around, someone bailed, and last minute Quinn was asked to be a camp counselor. He actually got a special shoutout at the welcome event (at which point I swear he winked at me to rub it in.) I've never felt more like a Disney movie villain. -- Nadine Ott",
            "Quinn has a wonderful gift of being able to engage with anyone, at any time, with any topic. He has an incredibly curiosity that gives him a wealth of material and experience to draw from, that he uses to empathize with and beeveryone around him. I've seen him use this to great effect in all sorts of settings - whether its a new LiveRamper attending their first back bar happy hour, or a nervous candidate he's interviewing, Quinn instantly welcomes newcomers with humor and kindness that makes them feel at ease and at home. This combination of curiosity and empathy makes Quinn an awesome mentor, co-worker, and friend, and will ensure his success wherever he goes! -- Parker Mossman",
            "I remember the first time I interacted with Quinn at the back bar and immediately knew I had some social competition. I was already so intrigued by the fact that someone from engineering was interested in talking to me since my networks at LiveRamp didnt extend beyond sales and product but I was completely invested in making this friendship a thing. Every time I went up to the back bar after that, hoping to see Quinn, he would be there, usually at the center of some wild conversation about something everyone in the circle was completely taken by. So naturally, I knew the strategic move was to form an alliance with this social butterfly so I could get in on all these inside jokes (and make more eng friends obv). Quinn was quick to let me in on all the hot eng slack channels highlighting where I could find the spicy goss. Overtime I found that some nights I’d just want to talk to Quinn about whatever projects he was working on. All to say that most of you know how the story goes from here, but I have been completely enamored by his radiance, passion, honesty and consideration for others since I met him that fateful day. LiveRamp will honestly never be the same without him but is so much better off because of he was here. -- Kendall Sopoci",
            'Every interaction I\'ve had with Quinn was funny. He spent the last 3 years extrapolating that all French words have a silent P that we actually should pronounce, calling me Bap by just "hinting the P", and teaching me fun expressions like "shredding the gnar", "tognar" or "buttering the mashed potatoes". I\'ll miss seeing his face at work but I know we\'ll continue to plan on seeing each other in Tahoe and not do it! -- Baptiste Benet',
            "It was very lucky that Alex paired all the interns in my year with mentors that had similar names, because that mean I (Quenneville) got paired with Quinn, who is the best mentor, teammate, and you could hope to have. Quinn has a knack for teaching and problem-solving, but more importantly he is really talented at empowering people and nging them together. I think it’s hard to quantify how profoundly Quinn has influenced me as a developer and human. Wherever my career and life take me, it’ll without a doubt be thanks to the skills and values I learned from Quinn over the past few years. -- Dylan Quenneville",
            "When I first heard about CCPA, I felt sorry for whatever team was going to have to sort through the tedious legal requirements and wrangle engineers into compliance. A year later and I’d happily talk your ear off about how privacy is so much more than compliance, and how important it is for engineers to understand privacy laws because they fundamentally change how we should think about data. It goes without saying that Quinn is the reason for this change in thinking. I’m continually impressed by his ability to make people excited about what they do and feel the importance in it. He’s not afraid of a challenge, and I’m so grateful to all of the times he’s encouraged me to think bigger. Quinn cares deeply about his work and his team and that passion is contagious. We’re going to miss him. -- Eloise Dietz",
            "Quinn introduced me to the term “All Gucci” I’ve slowly worked it into my lexicon and I feel a whole lot cooler now. Thanks Quinn! -- Zachary Cicala",
            "Quinn was one of the first people I met from LiveRamp and he’s a huge part of why I ended up joining.  His genuine enthusiasm for literally any subject brightens up my day each time.  Be it elixir, vim, or CCPA, Quinn has a spicy take on it.  It’s been an amazing time working with him, and I’ve become a better developer and learned about so many esoteric languages and tools thanks to him.  We’ll miss you Quinn! -- Austin Hsu",
            "The Titles of Quinn<br><br>1) Quinn the Universal Net-Positive: I am in the unique position of having worked both directly with Quinn on the same team (old school data store), and then having Quinn as a primary stakeholder. I can tell you this: Quinn is top-tier in both variants. Quinn stood up for me as a teammate, and vouched for my team when he was a stakeholder. Whether you're grinding through storytime, or ruthlessly debating business value, having Quinn present in a meeting always ups the fun factor. Also, I have observed that backbars, dinners, and other social activities without Quinn were never as good as those with Quinn present. Thus, as a contributor to the Quinn mythos, I posit that he is incapable of detracting from any situation, and propose that Quinn be given the title of Universal Net-Positive.<br><br>2) Quinn the Cool: Quinn always has the coolest ideas for solving problems. I don't know where he gets his cool ideas from, but it's definitely correlated with his coolness as a person. Back when we were on the same team working with rough legacy code, Quinn and I would bounce fresh ideas off each other all day, and I cannot overstate how much happier that made me at work. Socially, Quinn is also obviously cool. Thus, Quinn is cool. Just look at the guy. To deny it would be foolish. To capstone his coolness, Quinn doesn't flex his cool status either.<br><br>3) Quinn the Communicator: Quinn is the most masterful verbal articulator of nuanced concepts I have ever worked with. If aliens arrived on Earth and we sent Quinn as our ambassador, it is a guarantee that they'd at least come to understand our collective plight before they abducted him. Without knowing anything about nuclear fusion, Quinn could explain nuclear fusion to an amoeba, and if the amoeba was human it would have understood him completely.<br><br>4) Quinn the Oquinnionated: Sometimes, when paralyzed in the stormy waters of indecision, you just want a strong opinion on where to steer. You can be damned sure that Quinn will answer your call every time, and hand you a Quinn Compass™. These rigged compasses have no regard for the Earth's magnetic field, but anecdotally they boast an above-average paradise-locator rate. 9/10 would recommend.<br><br>-- Forest Gagnon",
            "On my first day Quinn told me “You should probably remap your send message key in Slack so you don’t send stupid messages that you’ll regret” This has saved me many times. -- Zachary Cicala",
            "Quinn uses vim, which is correct. -- Bob",
            "I first met Quinn during my onsite at LiveRamp during the lunch section, where I distinctly remember his as “guy very knowledgeable and fond of llamas”, which I found strange because I didn’t believe that animal was common in this country. Cool guy, strongly opinionated and very principled. Will greatly miss his presence at LiveRamp. -- Pratik Mallya",
            "Although Quinn was the first engineer I spoke with at LR, and then later my manager (twice), when you add it all up, I’ve only ever had the chance to work with him for a couple of weeks. But every time we have joined forces, however briefly, it’s been a time to learn, and grow, and have fun at work. Each time, counted as one of my favorite experiences at LiveRamp. And each time, I was left with that bittersweet aftertaste of having had a great encounter, but also knowing that it could not last. We’re gonna miss you Quinn! -- Chuck Hagy",
